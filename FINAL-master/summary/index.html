<h3> SUMMARY </h3>
													
												
<p>
A lot was learned in the course of developing this project.
<br><br>
I spoke to designers, people working in the non-profit sector, parents, and just 'average' everyday people. 
						<br><br>
Data privacy is something most people understand is important, and they want to do more of, but the hurdles to know where to begin and teh dryness of the subject matter makes it very unlikely that people will ever actively seek this type of information out.
<br><br>
Although surveil is just barely ready to hit newsstands, there is already a waitles to get copies. The project feels like the start of many successes. While the breadth of a zine format is digestible in capacity and beautiful to look at, there is plenty of ground left to be covered on this subject matter. Hashing the details of NSA and PRISM programs, talking only about children's rights to data privacy and many more topics leaves this work as an ongoing project.
<br><br>
Ideally, if this first iteration is an introductory success, this project will live on with an online store providing multi-volumes with niche subject matter as it relates to data privacy.
