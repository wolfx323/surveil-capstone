<h1> Surveil </h1>
								
<h2>DOES DATA PRIVACY MATTER?</h2>								
												
<p>
The simple answer, unfortunately, is that there is very little being done in the way of data privacy laws and regulations. <br> <br> Surveil is a project that takes an analog, often frivolous form of media (the zine) and attempts to have complete connection between the digital world and analog by having an online presence (a splash page to locate a copy of the project) a real-world component (the zine) that leads the user back to the digital world again with a PDF download code that accompanies the zine, to increase sharability amongst peers. Thus, data and acessiblity come full cirle. <br> <br> In this way, the project blurs the lines between the digital and analog modes of communications, and gets the basics of data privacy as a concept, why it matters, and what to do about protecting that privacy into as many hands as possible.</met> </p>
